# IBM Font Class Parameters

## Introduction

### Specification

This section defines the IBM Font Class and the IBM Font Subclass
parameter values to be used in the classification of font designs by the
font designer or supplier. This information is stored in the
sFamilyClass field of a font's OS/2 table.

sFamilyClass

Format: 2-byte signed short

Title: Font-family class and subclass. Also see section 3.4.

Description: This parameter is a classification of font-family design.

Comments: The font class and font subclass are registered values
assigned by IBM to each font family. This parameter is intended for use
in selecting an alternate font when the requested font is not available.
The font class is the most general and the font subclass is the most
specific. The high byte of this field contains the family class, while
the low byte contains the family subclass.

These values classify a font design as to its appearance, but do not
identify the specific font family, typeface variation, designer,
supplier, size, or metric table differences. It should be noted that
some font designs may be classified equally well into more than IBM Font
Class or Subclass. Such designs should be matched to a classification
for which substitution of another font design from the same class or
subclass would generally result in a similar appearance of the presented
document.

## Class ID = 0 No Classification

classification or that the design classification is not of significance
to the creator or user of the font resource.
